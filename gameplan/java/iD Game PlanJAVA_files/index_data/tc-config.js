  "en-US": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Used by over 5 billion devices, Java is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages. From the basics of programming (used for the AP exam since 2004!) to building complex systems, Java is a great way to delve into coding and computer science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will start by completing coding challenges to strengthen your understanding of new concepts. Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll explore game programming with Processing, learning about 2D movement and collisions, then you&amp;rsquo;ll code apps with user input and feedback at their core. As you progress, you&amp;rsquo;ll realize you don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait until after high school to get a college education. Stick it out with Java, and you&amp;rsquo;ll build programs that utilize advanced sorting and searching algorithms creating projects that will impress colleges and future colleagues alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Java, it&amp;rsquo;s about more than just learning the basics. You can expand your skillset endlessly and prepare for your dream career before you even graduate high school.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;iD Code&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;lesson to get started!&lt;/p&gt;"
